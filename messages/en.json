    "helenaDescription": "My name is Lena. Last year, I completed the JSFE course. I already have some work experience — I was part of an infrastructure team at an IT company in Russia. I was responsible for building a React component library. The work was quite specific with many nuances. However, I didn’t work with many tools — there was no interaction with the backend, I had no experience with Next.js, among other things. Six months ago, I moved to Croatia and left my job. I decided to continue learning and explore the tools I hadn’t worked with before.",
    "mayaDescription": "My name is Maya, and I am in the process of learning to become a developer. I currently live in the USA and am working through the JSFE course, as well as taking the React course from RSSchool. My goal is to continue growing as a developer and eventually work on building complex, full-stack applications."
